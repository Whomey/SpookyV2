                    <p class="desc">Fort 
                        Ontario was originally built in 1755 during the French and 
                        Indian War. It’s original name and therefore its name at this 
                        time was Fort of the Six Nations, until it was destroyed in 
                        1756 by the French. It was then rebuilt by the British in 
                        1759 and went through many more battles and it was also 
                        destroyed and rebuilt a number of times as well. The last 
                        time it was used before the 20th century was during the 
                        American Civil War where it was rebuilt in fear of British 
                        help from Canada. The 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry 
                        Division then used it as a home base until its deactivation 
                        in 1940. Then the fort was used for what it’s most popular 
                        for today, helping refugees. The fort held a little under 
                        1,000 jewish refugees during world war II and was then 
                        called the Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Center. It held 
                        the refugees from 1944 to 1946 until the war was over and 
                        it was proven to be safe for the refugees. This history is 
                        where the stories of hauntings has come from. There are 
                        reports of multiple ghost sightings at the Fort and at its 
                        cemetery. Some of these sightings are things like the sounds 
                        of children giggling or crying or even just civil war soldiers 
                        seen walking around. There are also stories like if someone 
                        were to walk over George Fikes cemetery they would be haunted 
                        for the rest of their lives, but if you jump over it you can 
                        choose someone to be haunted for the rest of their lives. 
                        There’s also said to be a headless civil war soldier who can 
                        be seen roaming the tracks that are between the fort and the 
                        lake.
