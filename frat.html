                    <p class="desc">The 
                        Fraternity of Sigma Tau Chi sits on a lake side lot next to 
                        breitbeck park in northern oswego. This site has a wide range 
                        of history as the house was built in 1847. There are pictures 
                        of the view of the backyard from the third floor fire escape. 
                        It was once used as one of the final stops on the underground 
                        railroad, because of its close vicinity to the lake and canada, 
                        and has a wide network of tunnels underneath the home used for 
                        hiding slaves. It is understood that there were also many deaths 
                        of freedom seeking slaves on the premise. These tunnels have since 
                        collapsed but the entrance to them still resides in the basement of 
                        the home, and is shown in the pictures taken. The basement has had a 
                        lot of paranormal activity in the form of ghosts roaming the hallways, 
                        and human voices echoing through the basement as reported by pledges who 
                        were down there over the years. The house also has hauntings in the form 
                        of deceased brothers. In one of the more documented cases a brother named 
                        Craig Schiesser passed away while sleeping in one of the rooms on the second
                         floor. He was sick and went to mary walker health center to receive a 
                         diagnosis. They told him he was suffering from a common cold and to go 
                         home to get rest. He did not wake up the next morning and it was revealed
                          that he died from meningitis, not the common cold he was falsely diagnosed 
                          with. He has since haunted the room in which he died in, and the house in 
                          general. In one case a few current brothers bought an ouija board and 
                          attempted to contact any spirits in the home. There were many they received 
                          contact with but when they came in contact with craig schiesser he claimed 
                          he was a bad spirit when asked. There is a picture of the shrine put together 
                          in his honor that resides in the fraternity chapel. However the shrine was 
                          not enough to put his spirit to rest and he still knocks items off walls and 
                          causes ruckus in the room he passed away in on the second floor.
