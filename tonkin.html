                    <p class="desc">Tonkin Mansion is located on the corner of 
                        West 5th Street and Seneca Street and it has a rather odd history. 
                        In 1899 an 11 year old girl who was a daughter of one of the richest 
                        families in the area died of appendicitis. Her parents put her dead 
                        body into a sealed glass topped coffin and had the wake and in a way 
                        the funeral in the library of the house. Her coffin was then kept in 
                        her room until the family built a family mausoleum in a cemetery nearby. 
                        Even though the mausoleum was made the family didnâ€™t plan on putting their 
                        daughter in it anytime soon. The story of the girl in the glass coffin soon 
                        began to spread and so did the rumors. Some rumors said that the family used 
                        her coffin as a dining table other said that they family brought tin potential 
                        suitors for the deceased daughter. About a year after the passing of the 
                        daughter the police intervened and forced the family to put her into the 
                        family mausoleum, but the families stories and rumors had already given 
                        people ideas. An unknown artist started sending death threats to the 
                        families other daughter with drawings of the interior of the house and 
                        detailed descriptions of how the artist would kidnap the daughter. 
                        Then a local child was mutilated and murdered which made the Tonkins 
                        hire armed bodyguards as well as try to go into hiding multiple times. 
                        Today the house has been turned into apartments and the remains of the 
                        Tonkins daughter can be visited in the families mausoleum.
