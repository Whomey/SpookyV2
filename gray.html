                    <p>Gray Roads story/legend comes from a story that if you stop on the tracks on 
                    Gray Road you will see a ghost running towards your car. There have also been 
                    reported sightings of the Headless Horseman on the tracks. These hauntings come 
                    from past stories of murders and suicides and even deaths caused by trains. 
                    One story is about a cab driver named Frank Coolidge who was driving a man 
                    named Garry Rhinehardt to a known lovers lane, when Rhinehardt unloaded a .22 
                    caliber pistol into the back of Coolidge. Coolidge ran the car into a tree and 
                    died and Rinehardt escaped by hitchhiking towards Syracuse. Also, in the 1920’s 
                    a woman got into a fight with her husband and afterwards walked into the woods 
                    and hung herself. It’s said that she can be seen walking through the woods near 
                    Gray Road searching for answers. Screams and light orbs have also been seen or 
                    heard in the woods, which is believed to be the cab driver or the woman who
                    committed suicide. There are more deaths as well, including a house fire that claimed 
                    seven lives and a train hitting a carriage that killed a ten year old boy.
